Arithmetic Slices
3.1 - The common behavior that we can observe is that we have a sequence of numbers, we check if that sequence
is a valid slice and then we can add 1 more number to that slice. Since
we have already computed if the slice is valid or not, we just need to check
that the slice with the next number is valid, that is if the difference between
new number and previous is the same.

If the last step is valid, we can add another number and check again.
If at any point we have an invalid slice, we can reset the streak
, mark the begining of the new slice and repeat what we have stated.


3.2 - In this case we don't need to store solutions in a data structure.
Since we are keeping track of count, a variable to count and another for the
difference between the last two numbers will sufice. We will traverse the
whole input once while counting and resseting if the current slice is valid.
